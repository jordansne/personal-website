            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hello! I'm a software developer that loves to work with all things tech - be it software, hardware, management
            or administration. Much of my software related experience lies with JavaScript, however I've also worked with
            Java, C++ and Python. Full stack JavaScript development is one of my greater interests, where I specialize in
            React and Node.js based apps. I plan on graduating at Western University with a Specialization in Computer Science
            &amp; a Minor in Software Engineering. I pride myself on developing software that's efficient, easy to understand
            &amp; use, and well-written. I've gained my experience through a combination of personal projects, school projects
            &amp; various hackathons.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <h3>Personal Projects</h3>

            <p><b><a href="https://github.com/jordansne/ntwitbot/" target="_blank"><u>NTwitBot</u></a> -- Twitter Ebooks
            Bot</b></p>
            <p>NTwitBot is a Twitter ebooks bot written in Node.js. It was developed with the idea of being easy to set up and
            use. I started this project to familiarize myself with JavaScript and the basic use of REST APIs. Recently, I've
            begun to dive into unit &amp; integration testing, which I've found very helpful in writing cleaner code.</p><br>

            <p><b><a href="https://github.com/jordansne/personal-website" target="_blank"><u>Personal Website</u></a> -- My
            Personal Showcase</b></p>
            <p>This website has been developed by me from scratch using only a bit of jQuery and font-awesome icons to
            showcase my past, present &amp; future projects.</p><br>

            <p><b><a href="https://github.com/jordansne/jnodrops" target="_blank"><u>JNoDrops</u></a> -- Bukkit Plugin</b></p>
            <p>This was my first open source project that was written in Java. It is a simple bukkit plugin to allow server
            administrators to regulate item dropping.</p>

            <h3>Univeristy Projects</h3>

            <p><b><a href="https://github.com/jordansne/sport-manager/" target="_blank"><u>Sport Manager</u></a> --
            Third Year Databases Assignment</b></p>
            <p>Sport Manager is a web app that allows a user to manage a database for a sports league. It uses the PERN stack
            (Postgres, Express, React, Node) to provide a single page interface to manage team, game and official information,
            as well as displaying a few extra stats for The Maple Leafs (as assignment was originally mocking the NHL). It was
            developed according to the assignment specifications. See the my Github (link above) for some
            demonstrations.</p><br>

            <p><b><a href="https://github.com/jordansne/wt-addressbook-generator/" target="_blank"><u>Wt Address Book
            Generator</u></a> -- Third Year OOP Assignment</b></p>
            <p>Wt Address Book Generator is a simple web server written in C++ &amp; Wt. It uses fundamental object oriented
            design principles to provide a frontend UI and a couple of REST API endpoints. It allowed me to experiment with
            server side rendering for the first time.</p><br>

            <p><b><a href="https://github.com/jordansne/team3-gproject/" target="_blank"><u>EmptyMyFridge</u></a> -- Second
            Year Software Eng. Group Project</b></p>
            <p>EmptyMyFridge is a recipe discovery website that allows a user to input all the ingredients they have available
            to them and then outputted is a list of recipes that incoperate those ingredients. With heavy integration of
            Firebase web services to provide a database and user authentication, our group developed a Grails backend to
            utilize Spoonacular's Recipe API for recipe searching. The majority of our app was developed in the frontend,
            where the React view library was used to provide a single page interactive web app.</p><br>
